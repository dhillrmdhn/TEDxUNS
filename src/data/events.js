      'Finding X was a campaign to spread the word about TEDxUNS among UNS students before our staff recruitment. We had placed mysterious X posters in busy spots around UNS. With the tagline "Find the-X", we wanted UNS students to hunt for these X posters. Exciting prizes awaited those who successfully found them. Those who successfully found them all had a chance to win exciting prizes. By taking part in this fun initiative, students could not only find the X posters but also learn more about the TEDxUNS community.',
